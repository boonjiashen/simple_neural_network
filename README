RUN
----------------------------------------
>> ./neuralnet <training_set_file.arff> <n_folds> <learning_rate> <n_epochs>

Arguments:
Positional argument 1: name of training set file
Positional argument 2: number of folds for cross-validation
Positional argument 3: learning rate of stochastic gradient descent
Positional argument 4: number of epochs for training

The program does stratified cross validation with the specified number of
folds. As output, it prints one line for each instance (in the same order as
the data file) indicating (i) the fold to which the instance was assigned (1 to
n), (ii) the predicted class, (iii) the actual class, (iv) the confidence of
the instance being positive (i.e. the output of the sigmoid).
